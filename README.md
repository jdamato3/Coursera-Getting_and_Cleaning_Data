# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The script run_analysis.R performs the following actions:
 - Downloads the dataset from the provided URL
 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 - From the data set in the previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for    each activity and each subject.
